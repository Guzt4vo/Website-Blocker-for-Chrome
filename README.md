# Website-Blocker-for-Chrome
Google Chrome extension that enables users with the ability to block websites according to the chrome match pattern

Created by Gustavo Jimenez Castro at the University of Central FLorida.

This is the first version of the app, the ultimate goal is for it to give users the ability to add and remove urls from the filter as they see fit.

To use the extension you need to download the files in its appropriate folder then head to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode and hit the load unpacked button.
